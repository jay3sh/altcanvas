# Maemo Publishr #

Download the latest (0.5) version from [Downloads ](http://code.google.com/p/altcanvas/downloads/list)

I have ported the publishr GUI to run on Maemo platform (a.k.a Nokia Internet tablets - n770, n800, n810).

This application will let you publishr your images from internet tablet to your Flickr/Picasaweb account. This will be very useful for n800 and n810 devices, because they have in-build camera. This way you can take a picture with an n8x0 device and directly upload it to your online albums at Flickr/Picasaweb.

This is pure python app and has no dependencies, except standard python2.5 runtime.

(P.S. If you like this app, check out [maemo-blogger](http://jyro.blogspot.com/2008/01/blog-from-nokia-tablets.html) that I have put together)
