# AltPublishr for Maemo platform on n800,n810 #

After porting publishr to Maemo, there were suggestions about making improvements for multiple photo upload interface. Also I came into possession of a brand new n810 by a stroke of luck. I had long time wanted to play with cairo and use those gradient surfaces in a useful UI.

So I decided to break away from GTK and implemented a GUI for Publishr from scratch using only pycairo (and the flickr, gdata backends from original program). The widgets and the animation effect are written from scratch.

Download the latest version (0.6.1) from the [downloads](http://code.google.com/p/altcanvas/downloads/list) page.
