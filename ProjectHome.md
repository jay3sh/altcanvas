### Inkface ###

Altcanvas is a project for developing a new and more intuitive GUI framework for handheld devices.

A key difference between handheld devices and desktop is the absence of keyboard. With the advent of touchscreen interfaces, the application GUI on handhelds need to be designed in a different paradigm. They should look more like natural objects rather than rectangular windows with titlebars.

The altcanvas project develops a GUI framework named "inkface" that enabled composing SVG based GUI. Graphic designers can compose GUI in an SVG image editor (like Inkscape) and programmers can wire their app logic with the hooks provided by inkface library.
